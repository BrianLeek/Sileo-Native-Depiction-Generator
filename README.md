Sileo Native Depiction Generator is used to create native depiction files to use for the Sileo application on your repo. The script uses a JSON file with placeholder text inside and when the script runs it creates a copy of that file and replaces the placeholder text with information that the users enters. I created this little project to help developers quickly create depiction files for their packages and to hopefully save them sometime.
